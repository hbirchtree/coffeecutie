# Support for AppImage format

Support has been made for a less strict mode of packaging, but also the FSH-model proposed by the creators.
By default, the less strict mode is used. To enable the standard mode, set APPIMAGE_FOLLOW_STANDARD=ON

Everything works as expected, since no attempt at isolation is being done.
