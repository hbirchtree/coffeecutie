# How to build and deploy for Windows?

You *will* need Visual Studio 2015 in order for compilation to work. (We need full C++11 support, not what VS2013 provides) Compiling 32-bit will not be supported officially; if that breaks, nobody cares.
No successful attempts have been made with Cygwin, MinGW-W64 and MSYS2 so far. (Please report back if it does work!)
