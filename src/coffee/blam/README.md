# Blam! data structures

This directory contains:
 - `volta` - Halo Combat Evolved data structures as well as STL wrappers

    Many of these data structures are sourced from grenadiac's SparkEdit source code

    Some of the structures are also from `KornnerStudios/Prometheus`

    Other structures are deduced from contents in memory

    None of this work would have been possible without previous work
     by grenadiac and KornnerStudios.

The goal of these structures is to be able to render the games' scenes.
Another goal is to do the above, but with minimal copying around in memory, essentially using the data in-place.
