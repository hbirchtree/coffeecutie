# Blam! data structures

This directory contains:
 - `volta` - Halo Combat Evolved data structures as well as STL wrappers
    Many of these data structures are sourced from grenadiac's SparkEdit source code
    Some of the structures are also from KornnerStudios/Prometheus
    Other structures are deduced from contents in memory

The goal of these structures is to be able to render the games' scenes.
Another goal is to do the above, but with minimal copying around in memory, essentially using the data in-place.
