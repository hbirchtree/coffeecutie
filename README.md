A C/C++ game engine/rendering engine

# What is this?
A game engine comprising a GL renderer (with full OpenGL 4.5 support), media playback (thanks to FFMPEG), a platform layer, audio through OpenAL and options for physics engines.

# What can I use it for?
Anything regarding graphics that needs high performance. The architecture makes will make use of as many threads as it needs to perform well. (In principle)

# What is the focus of this engine?
Being low-level, highly flexible, yet simple to use. Standard procedures are wrapped in convenience classes, but does not limit the ways in which a task can be performed. This makes it easy to use the library in many different, unique ways, while also remaining developer-friendly. See "examples/" directory for sample code and possible applications.
